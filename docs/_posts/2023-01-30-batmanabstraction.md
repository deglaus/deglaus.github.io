# Batman & the abstraction of adaptations
Having recently re-read some classic Batman comics, I have come to the realisation that adapting Batman, or any major comic book character for that matter, is more adapting the idea of the character, while building upon it. Adaptations will always entail the adapter(s) adding their own flavour to the source material, nothing strange about that. In the most basic case, we have a source material that is being adapted into something else, whether it be another medium, or the same. There is a clear *source-to-adaptation* relationship. 

What I claim occurs with a character such as Batman, is that because the character has existed for so long, there have been numerous iterations, most of whom are not even created by the original creators. For each generation, there may have been a different idea of what Batman "should be"; people growing up watching the Batman TV-show starring Adam West as its titular character may develop some different perceptions from those accustomed to Tim Burton's Batman film duology. But these are all adaptations, right? Exactly, the question is then "what is the source material?". Well, the comics! But which ones? 

Batman comics have gone through various eras and changed a lot since its inception, which is only natural. But because the "source material" keeps changing, it expands the definition of what Batman is or should be. All these versions of the character co-exist, thus you could argue that they are *all equally Batman*. What is happening here is that the idea of Batman is becoming abstract. Batman of the modern era is not just the continuation of the original stories, but instead the culmination of all previous Batman material; *including adapations*! This is why it is interesting to me. We have the original medium, the Batman Detective Comics, being influenced by adaptations that are supposedly drawing from some "original" idea of Batman. But in reality, all Batman creations are influenced by each other; there is no longer a *source-to-adaptation* relationship, but instead more of a *sources-to-adapatation-to-sources-to-sources-,...,-to-adaptation* relationship. Simply put, it is complex.

Who is Batman? Well, he is Bruce Wayne. Yes, but not always. It might be Dick Grayson, Jace Fox or Thomas Wayne depending on which story you follow. When adapting Batman, the adapter can pick and choose various details from other works in order to either include it directly, or to have it be part of the character's background. For example, Jason Todd's death is a common element to include in order to bring in an element of deep regret for Batman. *The Batman* movie from 2022 drew some inspiration from the *Long Halloween* and *Dark Victoryu* comic series, which in turn have directly, or in-directly gotten some of its material from the original run of *Detective Comics*. What is Batman is where much a product of our current time, and it will just keep on changing in order to adapt to the times. May the character, and all other long-lasting comic book characters, live long and keep us engaged.
