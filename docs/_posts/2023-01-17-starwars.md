# Rediscovering and chasing down the Star Wars Trilogy

Being a very young kid around the time when *Revenge of the Sith* was fresh in theaters, the *Star Wars* franchise was all around me. Pretty much all my friends and me were enthralled by the cool action scenes with massive spaceship battles and of course the lightsaber duels, and we often played out our own imagined scenarios in which we could become a wise and powerful Jedi knight, or a cunning and evil Sith-lord. Though, being such a young fan in a non-English speaking country,[^1] I could only enjoy the movies for their visual and musical spectactle. The story, as I understood it was via the mumbling cutscenes and levels of *Lego Star Wars: The Video Game* and *Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy*. The Lego Star Wars sets also played a major role in the childhood experience of immersing myself in the fictional universe, a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.

[^1]: To clarify, I could not understand the dialogue nor had I developed the ability to read subtitles yet.

## The rediscovery

Growing up with Star Wars, it was almost taken for granted to me. It was not until my early teenage years when I randomly decided to revisit these movies. I quickly discovered that there was a significant difference in quality of writing, and over all timelessness when it came to comparing the original trilogy to the prequel trilogy. The former had such tremendous qualities; essentially combining a whole number of elements from various sources into one ultimate packet. The latter, on the other hand, I could not get behind in the same way. It was the wooden dialogue combined with how artificial everything looked in the prequels,[^3]  especially compared to the lived-in grimy look of the originals. As for the original trilogy, I fell in love with their story, characters and the dynamics between our main cast of characters. The force was a mystical essence, and a way of life -- but also the cool utlitity I recall it being for action. Needless to say, I could enjoy the original Star Wars trilogy in a whole different way now, all these years later. Though what was earthshattering to me was the revelation that the available versions of the original trilogy, that I grew up on, are in fact *not the original versions* of the films!

## Finding the _original_ Star Wars Trilogy

Upon realising that I (most likely) had never watch the original, theatrical versions of the Star Wars trilogy, I made it my mission to get my hands on these editions of the films. After doing some research, I discovered that the 1995 VHS versions of the films *were the originals*, and incidentally found and subsequently purchased a box-set of them at a second-hand store, despite not owning a VHS player. I decided it was not worth it to buy one just for the sake of watching three films; I ended up getting to screen *Star Wars* and the *Empire Strikes Back* at some family members' home. Watching these original versions of the films felt quite special to me, but the obsession did not stop here. I also got the limited edition 2006 DVDs which contained a low-resolution laserdisc transfers of the original trilogy on its bonus discs.[^2]

But both the DVDs and VHS tapes did not have the films in all of their original cinematic glory. The next step for me was to dwell into the world of fanedits, where I found Harmy's Despecialized Editions. These editions are fanedits, that combine various sources in order to frankenstein together a coherent-looking theatrically accurate version of the films. The only projects that supersede Harmy's edits in terms of quality are that of Team Negative One. Team Negative One have currently produced 4K resolution editions of both *Return of the Jedi* (*4K83*) and *Star Wars* (*4K77*), sourced from self-scanned 35mm film prints. These editions look stunning, and they are the ultimate way to watch these films in their original theatrical form. The team are currently working on restoring the *Empire Strikes Back* as well. I suggest tracking down Team Negative One's 4K83 and 4K77, and Harmy's Despecialized Edition of the Empire Strikes Back for the current optimal viewing experience! Though it should be noted that some people may prefer the cleaner look of the Despecialized Editions, which is completely fine; it is a matter of personal preference at the end of the day.

As of late, it has been a fun project for me to burn my own custom blu-rays of these theatrical versions of the Star Wars trilogy! I have also done the same for Hal9000's Fanedits of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, which you can read about [here](https://originaltrilogy.com/topic/Some-info-help-for-the-Hal-9000-Edits-of-the-Prequel-Sequel-Trilogies-more/id/60855).

[^2]: These editions of the films are often colloquially known as George's Original Unaltered Trilogy (GOUT).



[^3]: This is written to mostly reflect how I felt at the time; there are plenty of elements to appreciate about the Star Wars prequels. As the years have gone on, I have come to enjoy many of its concepts and the world that it established, mostly thanks to the *Clone Wars* show, which I have yet to finish! But the prequel films are still not good in my opinion.
